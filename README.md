# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on various features. The aim is to provide accurate price estimates to assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions.
Key Features:

Dataset: A comprehensive dataset comprising historical house sale records, including attributes such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant factors.
Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation techniques were employed to prepare the dataset for model training.
Model Selection: Exploration and evaluation of multiple regression models, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to identify the best-performing algorithm.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected model using appropriate training techniques, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance using various metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Feature Importance: Analyzing the significance of different features in determining house prices through feature importance techniques like permutation importance, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values.
Deployment: A user-friendly web application or API implementation allowing users to input house features and receive predicted price estimates using the trained model.
Technologies and Tools Used:

Python: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and other relevant libraries for data manipulation, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Jupyter Notebook: Creating an interactive environment for data exploration, model development, and result visualization.
Machine Learning: Utilizing regression algorithms and techniques to build and train the predictive model.
